# sed & awk, 2nd Edition, Â© 1997

## Preface

Because there is a natural progression in learning from **grep** to sed to awk, we will be covering all three programs, although the focus is on sed and awk.

Sed, so called because it is a stream editor, is perfect for applying a series of edits to a number of files.

Awk, named after its developers, Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan, is a programming language that permits easy manipulation of structured data and the generation of formatted reports.

### Availability of sed and awk

What is the modern alternative to awk?

"The Pyed Piper", or pyp, is a linux command line text manipulation tool similar to awk or sed, but which uses standard python string and list methods as well as custom functions evolved to generate fast results in an intense production environment.
