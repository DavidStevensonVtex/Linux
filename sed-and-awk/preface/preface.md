# sed & awk, 2nd Edition, Â© 1997

## Preface

Because there is a natural progression in learning from **grep** to sed to awk, we will be covering all three programs, although the focus is on sed and awk.

Sed, so called because it is a stream editor, is perfect for applying a series of edits to a number of files.

Awk, named after its developers, Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan, is a programming language that permits easy manipulation of structured data and the generation of formatted reports.
