## Chapter 5: Basic sed Commands

The sed command set consists of 25 commands. In this chapter, we introduce four new editing commands: **d** (delete), **a** (append), **i** (insert), and **c** (change). We also look at ways to change the flow control (i.e. determine which command is executed next) with a script.
