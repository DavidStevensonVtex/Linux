## Chapter 1: Power Tools for Editing

### May You Solve Interesting Problems

The primary motivation for learning _sed_ and _awk_ is that they are useful for devising general solutions to text editing problems.*

* I suppose this section title is a combination of the ancient Chinese curse "May you live in interesting times" and what Tim O'Reilly once said to me, that someone will solve a problem if he finds the problem interesting.

Given the choice of using _vi_ or _sed_ to make a series of repeated edits over a number of files, I will choose sed, simply because it makes the problem more intresting to me.

Part of solving a problem is knowing which tool to build. You have to keep in mind what kinds of applicatinos are best suited for sed and awk.
