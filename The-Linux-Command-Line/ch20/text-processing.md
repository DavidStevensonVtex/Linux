### Applications of Text

#### Documents

Many people write documents using plain text formats.

Many scientific papers are written using this method, as Unix-based text processing systems were among the first systems that supported the advanced typographical layout needed by writers in technical disciplines.

#### Web Pages

Web pages are text documents that use either Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) as markup languages to describe the documents visual format.

An email begins with a header that describes the source of the message and processing it received during its journey, followed by the body of the message with its content.
