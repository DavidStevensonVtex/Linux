## Chapter 7: Seeing the world as the shell sees it

* echo Display a line of text

### Expansion

`echo this is a test`

```
$ echo *
shell.md
```

Wildcards are expanded to file names.

### Pathname Expansion

```
$ echo D*
Derby Desktop Documents Downloads
```

```
$ echo *s
Documents Downloads Pictures Templates Videos
```

```
$ echo .*
. .. .bash_history .bash_logout .bashrc .byobu .cache .config .dbus .dotnet .emacs.d .gitconfig .gnupg .ICEauthority .java .lesshst .local .mongodb .mozilla .pki .profile .python_history .redhat .sh_history .ssh .sudo_as_admin_successful .thunderbird .vscode
```

`ls -d .* | less`

#### Tilde Expansion

The tilde character (~) has special meaning.
It expands into the name of the home directory.

```
$ echo ~
/home/dstevenson
```

#### Arithmetic Expansion

```
$ echo $((2 + 2))
4
```

Operators / Description
* \+ Addition
* \- Subtraction
* \* Multiplication
* \/ Division
* \% Modulo
* \*\* Exponentiation

Spaces are not significant in arithmetic expressions, and expressions can be nested.

```
$ echo $(($((5**2)) * 3))
75
```

[Shell Arithmetic](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Arithmetic.html)

Arithmetic expansion is covered in greater detail in Chapter 34.

#### Brace Expansion

Files do not need to exist for these examples to work.

```
$ echo Front-{A,B,C}-Back
Front-A-Back Front-B-Back Front-C-Back
```

```
$ echo Number_{1..5}
Number_1 Number_2 Number_3 Number_4 Number_5
```

In bash version 4.0 and newer, integers may also be _zero-padded_ like so:

```
$ echo {01..15}
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

```
$ echo {Z..A}
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A
```

```
$ echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b
aA1b aA2b aB3b aB4b
```

So, what is this good for? The most common application is to 
make lists of files or directories to be created.

```
$ mkdir Photos
$ cd Photos
$ mkdir {2007..2009}-{01..12}
$ ls
2007-01  2007-07  2008-01  2008-07  2009-01  2009-07
2007-02  2007-08  2008-02  2008-08  2009-02  2009-08
2007-03  2007-09  2008-03  2008-09  2009-03  2009-09
2007-04  2007-10  2008-04  2008-10  2009-04  2009-10
2007-05  2007-11  2008-05  2008-11  2009-05  2009-11
2007-06  2007-12  2008-06  2008-12  2009-06  2009-12
```

#### Command Substitution

```
$ echo $(ls -d *s)
Documents Downloads Pictures Templates Videos
```

```
$ ls -l $(which cp)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 153976 Sep  5  2019 /bin/cp
```

```
$ file $(ls -d /usr/bin/* | grep zip)
/usr/bin/funzip:     ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=b9453771956bf0369a0a65476c7c42183dca34ba, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
/usr/bin/gpg-zip:    POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
/usr/bin/mzip:       symbolic link to mtools
/usr/bin/preunzip:   POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
/usr/bin/prezip:     POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
...
```

There is an alternate syntax for command substitution in older shell programs that is also supported in `bash`.

```
$ ls -l `which cp`
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 153976 Sep  5  2019 /bin/cp
```

#### Quoting

```
$ echo this is a           test
this is a test
```

##### Double Quotes

If we place text inside double quotes, all the special characters used by the shell lose their special meaning and are treated as ordinary characters. The exceptions are \$ (dollar sign), \\ (backslash), and \` (backtick).

This means that word  splitting, pathname expansion, tilde expansion, and brace expansion are suppressed;
however, parameter expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution are still carried out.

```
$ touch "two words.txt"
$ ls -l two words.txt
ls: cannot access 'two': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'words.txt': No such file or directory
$ ls -l "two words.txt"
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dstevenson dstevenson 0 Jan 29 14:30 'two words.txt'
```

```
$ echo "$USER $((2+2)) $(cal)"
dstevenson 4     January 2025      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
          1  2  3  4  
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11  
12 13 14 15 16 17 18  
19 20 21 22 23 24 25  
26 27 28 29 30 31     
                     
```

```
$ echo "this is a                test"
this is a                test
```

By defeault, word splitting looks for the presence of spaces, tabs, and newlines (line feed characters)
and treats them as _delimiters_ between words.
This means unquoted  spaces, tabas, and newlines are not considered to be part of the text.

The fact that newlines are considered delimiters by word-splitting mechanism causes an interesting,
albeit subtle, effect on command substitution.

```
$ echo $(cal)
January 2025 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
$ echo "$(cal)"
    January 2025      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
          1  2  3  4  
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11  
12 13 14 15 16 17 18  
19 20 21 22 23 24 25  
26 27 28 29 30 31     
                      
```

##### Single Quotes

If we need to suppress _all_ expansions, we use _single quotes_.

```
$ echo "text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER"
text ~/*.txt {a,b} foo 4 dstevenson
$ echo 'text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER'
text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER
```

##### Escaping Characters

Sometimes we want to quote only a single character. To do this, we can precede a character with a backslash,
which in this context is called the _escape character_.

```
$ echo "The balance for user $USER is: \$5.00"
The balance for user dstevenson is: $5.00
```

```
$ mv bad\&filename good_filename
```

To allow a backslash character to appear, escape it by typing \\\\.
