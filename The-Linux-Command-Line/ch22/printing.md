### A Brief History of Printing

#### Printing in the Dim Times

When printers were expensive and centralized, as they often were in the early days of Unix, it was common practice for many users to share a printer. To identify print jobs belonging to a particular user, a _banner page_ displaying the name of the user was often printed at the beginning of each print job.

#### Character-Based Printers

Printers of the 1980s were almost always _impact printers_.

Two of the popular technologies of that time were _daisy-wheel_ and _dot-matrix_ printing.

Low-numbered ASCII control codes provided a means of moving the printer's carriage and paper, using codes for carriage return, line feed, form feed, and so on.

```
$ zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | nroff -man | cat -A | head
LS(1)                            User Commands                           LS(1)$
$
$
$
N^HNA^HAM^HME^HE$
       ls - list directory contents$
$
S^HSY^HYN^HNO^HOP^HPS^HSI^HIS^HS$
       l^Hls^Hs [_^HO_^HP_^HT_^HI_^HO_^HN]... [_^HF_^HI_^HL_^HE]...$
$
```
The _^H_ (Ctrl-H) characters are the backspaces used to create the bold-face effect.


#### Graphical Printers

Laser printers with 300 dots per inch were created, but sending a bit for each pixel slowed networks.

The solution was the _page description language_ (PDL).

The first major PDL was _PostScript_ from Adobe Systems.

A _PostScript_ printer accepted a PostScript program as input.

#### Printing with Linux

Modern Linux systems employ two software suites to perform and manage printing.

* Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) - print drivers and print job management
* GhostScript - A _PostScript_ interpreter, acts as a Raster Image Processor (RIP).

### Preparing Files for Printing

#### pr -- Convert Text Files for Printing

**Common pr Options**

* +_first_[:_last_] Output a range of pages
* -_columns_ Organize the content of the page into the number of c olumns specified by _columns_.
* -a By default, multicolumn output is listed vertically. By adding the \-a (across) option, content is listed horizontally.
* -d Double-space output
* -f Use form feeds rather than carriage returns to separate pages
* -h _header_ In the center portion of the page header, use _header_ rather than the name of the file being processed
* -l _length_ Set page length to _length_. The default is 66 (US letter at 6 lines per inch).
* -n Number lines
* -o _offset_ Create a left margin _offset_ characters wide
* -w _width_ Set the page width to _width_. The default is 72

_pr_ is often used in pipelines as a filter

```
$ ls /usr/bin | pr -3 -w 65 | head
