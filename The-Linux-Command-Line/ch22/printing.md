### A Brief History of Printing

#### Printing in the Dim Times

When printers were expensive and centralized, as they often were in the early days of Unix, it was common practice for many users to share a printer. To identify print jobs belonging to a particular user, a _banner page_ displaying the name of the user was often printed at the beginning of each print job.

#### Character-Based Printers

Printers of the 1980s were almost always _impact printers_.

Two of the popular technologies of that time were _daisy-wheel_ and _dot-matrix_ printing.

Low-numbered ASCII control codes provided a means of moving the printer's carriage and paper, using codes for carriage return, line feed, form feed, and so on.

```
$ zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | nroff -man | cat -A | head
LS(1)                            User Commands                           LS(1)$
$
$
$
N^HNA^HAM^HME^HE$
       ls - list directory contents$
$
S^HSY^HYN^HNO^HOP^HPS^HSI^HIS^HS$
       l^Hls^Hs [_^HO_^HP_^HT_^HI_^HO_^HN]... [_^HF_^HI_^HL_^HE]...$
$
```
The _^H_ (Ctrl-H) characters are the backspaces used to create the bold-face effect.


#### Graphical Printers

Laser printers with 300 dots per inch were created, but sending a bit for each pixel slowed networks.

The solution was the _page description language_ (PDL).

The first major PDL was _PostScript_ from Adobe Systems.

A _PostScript_ printer accepted a PostScript program as input.

#### Printing with Linux

Modern Linux systems employ two software suites to perform and manage printing.

* Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) - print drivers and print job management
* GhostScript - A _PostScript_ interpreter, acts as a Raster Image Processor (RIP).

### Preparing Files for Printing

#### pr -- Convert Text Files for Printing

**Common pr Options**

* +_first_[:_last_] Output a range of pages
* -_columns_ Organize the content of the page into the number of c olumns specified by _columns_.
* -a By default, multicolumn output is listed vertically. By adding the \-a (across) option, content is listed horizontally.
* -d Double-space output
* -f Use form feeds rather than carriage returns to separate pages
* -h _header_ In the center portion of the page header, use _header_ rather than the name of the file being processed
* -l _length_ Set page length to _length_. The default is 66 (US letter at 6 lines per inch).
* -n Number lines
* -o _offset_ Create a left margin _offset_ characters wide
* -w _width_ Set the page width to _width_. The default is 72

_pr_ is often used in pipelines as a filter

```
$ ls /usr/bin | pr -3 -w 65 | head

### Sending a Print Job to a Printer

#### lpr -- Print Files (Berkeley Style)

The _lpr_ program can be used to send files to the printer. It may also be used in pipelines, as it accepts standard input.

`$ ls /usr/bin | pr -3 | lpr`

The report would be sent to the system's default printer.
To send the file to a different printer, the `-P` otion can be used like this:

`lpr -P printer_name`

To see a list of printers known to the system, use this:

`lpstat -a`

Many Linux distributions allow you to define a "printer" that outputs files to PDF, rather than printing on the physical printer. This is handy for experimenting with printing commands. Check your printer configuration program to see whether it supports this configuration. On some distributions, you may need to install additional packages (such as _cups-pdf) to enable this capability.

`sudo apt install cups`

Since Ubuntu 16:

`sudo apt-get install printer-driver-cups-pdf`

```
$ lpstat -a
PDF accepting requests since Mon 24 Feb 2025 12:55:51 PM EST
```

**Common _lpr_ Options**

* \-\# _number_ Set number of copies to _number_.
* -p Print each page with a shaded header with the date, time, job name, and page number. This so-called pretting-print option can be used when printing text files.
* -P printer Specify the name of the printer used for output. If no printer is specified, the system's default printer is used.
* -r Delete files after printing. This would be useful for programs that produce temporary printer-output files.

#### lp =-- Print Files (System V Style)

Like _lpr_, _lp_ accepts either files or standard input for printing. It differs from _lpr_ in that it supports a different (and slightly more sophisticated) option set.

**Common _lp_ Options**

* -d _printer_ Set the destination (printer) to _printer_. If no -d option is specified, the system default printer is used.
* -n _number_ Set the number of copies to _number_.
* -o landscape Set output to landscape orientation.
* -o fitplot Scale the file to fit the page. This is useful when printing images, such as JPEG files.
* -o scaling=_number_ Scale file to _number_. The value of 100 fills the page. Values less than 100 are reduced, while values greater than 100 cause the file to printed across multiple pages.
* -o cpi=_number_ Set the output characters per inch to _number_. The default is 6.
* -o page-bottom=_points_ Set the page margins. Values are expressed in _points_, a unit of typographic measurement. There are  72 points to an inch.
* -o page-left=_points_
* -o page-right=_points_
* -o page-top=_points_
* -P _pages_ Specify the list of pages. _pages_ may be expressed as a comma-separated list and/or a range, for example, 1,3,5,7-10.
