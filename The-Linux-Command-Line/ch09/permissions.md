# The Linux Command Line, 2nd Edition, Â© 2019

## Chapter 9: Permissions

* id Display user identity
* chmod Change a file's permissions
* umask Set the default file permissions
* su Run a shell as another user
* sudo Execute a command as another user
* chown Change a file's owner
* chgrp Change a file's group ownership
* passwd Change a user's passwd

### Owners, Group Members, and Everybody Else

```
$ ll /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1464 Dec 26 10:07 /etc/shadow
$ less /etc/shadow
/etc/shadow: Permission denied
```

Regular users do not have permission to read this file, as the owner is root, and the group is shadow.

In Unix terms, everybody means _world_.

```
$ id
uid=1000(dstevenson) gid=1000(dstevenson) groups=1000(dstevenson),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lpadmin),126(sambashare)
$ id -u
1000
$ id -g     # Group
1000
$ id -G     # Groups
1000 4 24 27 30 46 116 126
$ id -n -u      # User name
dstevenson
$ id -n -g      # Group names
dstevenson
$ id -n -G      # Groups names
dstevenson adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
```

User accounts are defined in the `/etc/passwd` file, and groups
are defined in the `/etc/group` file.

### Reading, Writing and Executing

Access rights to files and directories are defined in terms of read access, write access, and execution access.

```
$ > foo.txt
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dstevenson dstevenson 0 Jan 30 15:58 foo.txt
```

The first 10 characters of the listign are the _file attributes_. The first of these characters is the file type.

#### File Types

* \- A regular file
* d A directory
* l A symbolic link
* c A character special file. This file type refers to a device that handles data as a stream of bytes, such as a terminal or /dev/null.
* b A block special file. This file type refers to a device that handles data in blocks, such as a hard drive or DVD drive.

The remaining nine characters of the file attributes, called the file mode, represent the read, write, and execute permissions file's owner, the file's group owner, and everybody else.

* Owner rwx
* Group rwx
* World rwx

#### Permission Attributes

* r Allows a file to be opened and read
* w Allows a file to be written or truncated. This attribute does not allow files to be renamed or deleted. The ability to delete or rename files is determined by directory attributes.
* x Allows a file to be treated as a program and executed. Program files written in scripting languages must also be set as readable to be executed.


### chmod: Change File Mode (Permissions)

`chmod` supports two distinct ways of specifying mode changes.

* Octal number representation
* Symbolic representation

Octal is base 8.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, ...

Octal, Binary, File Mode

* 0 000 ---
* 1 001 --x
* 2 010 -w-
* 3 011 -wx
* 4 100 r--
* 5 101 r-x
* 6 110 rw-
* 7 111 rwx

```
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dstevenson dstevenson 0 Jan 30 16:11 foo.txt
$ chmod 600 foo.txt
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw------- 1 dstevenson dstevenson 0 Jan 30 16:11 foo.txt
```

`chmod` als supports a symbolic notation for specifying file modes.
Symbolic notation is divided into 3 parts.

* Who the change will affect
* Which operation will be performed
* What permission will be set

chmod Symbolic Notation

Symbol Meaning
* u Short for user, but means the file or directory owner
* g Group owner
* o Short for others but means world.
* a Short for all. This is a combination of u, g and o.

chmod Symbolic Notation Examples
* u+x Add execute permission for the owner
* u-x Remove execute permission for the owner
* +x Add execute permission for the owner, group, and world. This is equivalent to a+x.
* o-rw Removethe read and write permissions for anyone besides the owner and group owner
* go=rw Set the group owner and world to have read and write permissions. If either the group owner or the world previously had execute permission, it is removed.
* u+x,go=rw Add execute permission for the owner and set the permissions for the group and others to read and eecute. Multiple specifications may be separated by commas.

### Setting File Mode with the GUI

The Files application (GUI) In GNOME allows changing permissions by right-clicking on the file and selecting permissions, and then selecting the Permissions tab.

### umask: Set Default Permissions

```
$ umask
0002
$ > foo.txt
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dstevenson dstevenson 0 Jan 30 16:25 foo.txt
```

We can see that both the owner and group get read and write permissions, while evveryone else gets only read permission. The reason that world does not have write permission is because of the value of the mask. Repeating our example:

```
$ rm foo.txt
$ umask 0000 
$ > foo.txt
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw-rw-rw- 1 dstevenson dstevenson 0 Jan 30 16:27 foo.txt
```

When we set the mask to 0000 (effectively turning it off), we see that the file is now writable.
To understand how this works, we have to use octal numbers again.

* Original file mode: --- rw- rw- rw-
* Mask: 000 000 000 010
* Result: --- rw- rw- r--

If we look at a mask value of 0022, we can see what it does.

It appears that the bit mask supplied to umask turns off permission bits in user, group and world permissions.

* Original file mode: --- rw- rw- rw-
* Mask: 000 000 010 010
* Result: --- rw- r-- r--

Resetting umask permissions; cleaning up

`$ rm foo.txt; umask 0002`

### Some Special Permissions

Though we usually see an octal permission mask expressed as a three digit number, it is more technically correct to express it in four digits. Why? Because in addition to read, write and execute permissions, there are some other, les used, permission settings.

* _setuid bit_ (octal 4000) When applied to an executable file, it changes the effective user ID from that of the real user (the user actually running the program) to that of the program's owner. Most often this is given to a few programs owned by the superuser. When an ordinary user runs a program that is _setuid root_, the program runs with the effective privileges of the superuser.

* _setgid bit_ (octal 2000) changes the _effective group id_ from the real group ID of the real user to that of the file owner. If the setgid bit is set on a directory, newly created files in the directory will be  given the group ownership of the directory rather than the group ownership of the file's creator. This is useful in a shared directory when members of a common group need access to all the files in the directory, regardless of the file owner's primary group.

* _sticky bit_ (octoal 1000) This is a holdover from ancient Unix, where it was possible to mark an executable file as "not swappable". On files, Linux ignores the sticky bit, but if applied to a directory, it prevents users from deleting or renaming files unles the user is either the owner of the directory, the owner of the file, or the superuser. This is often used to control access to a shared directory, such as tmp.

Example: Assign setuid to a program:

chmod u+s program

Example: Assign setgid to a directory

chmod g+s dir

Example: Assigning the sticky bit to a directory

chmod +t dir

An example of a program that is setuid:

-rwsr-xr-x

An example of a diretory that has the setgid attribute:

drwxrwsr-x

An example of a directory with the sticky bit set:

drwxrwxrwt

### Changing Identities

There are three ways to take on an alternate identity:

1. Log out and log back in as the alternate user.
2. Use the `su` command.
3. Use the `sudo` command.

From within our own shell session, the `su` command allows you to assume the identity of another user and either start a new session with that user's ID or issue a single command as that user.

The `sudo` command allows an administrator to set up a configuration file called /etc/sudoers and define specific commands that particular users are permitted to execute under an assumed identity.

The choice of which command to use is largely determined by which Linux distribution you use. 
Your distribution probably includes both commands, but its configuratino will favor one or the other.
