### Owners, Group Members, and Everybody Else

```
$ ll /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1464 Dec 26 10:07 /etc/shadow
$ less /etc/shadow
/etc/shadow: Permission denied
```

Regular users do not have permission to read this file, as the owner is root, and the group is shadow.

In Unix terms, everybody means _world_.

```
$ id
uid=1000(dstevenson) gid=1000(dstevenson) groups=1000(dstevenson),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lpadmin),126(sambashare)
$ id -u
1000
$ id -g     # Group
1000
$ id -G     # Groups
1000 4 24 27 30 46 116 126
$ id -n -u      # User name
dstevenson
$ id -n -g      # Group names
dstevenson
$ id -n -G      # Groups names
dstevenson adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
```

User accounts are defined in the `/etc/passwd` file, and groups
are defined in the `/etc/group` file.
