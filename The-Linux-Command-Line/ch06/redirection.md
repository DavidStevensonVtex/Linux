## Chapter 6: Redirection

The I/O in I/O Redirection stands for Input/Output.

* cat Concatenate files
* sort Sort lines of text
* uniq Report or omit repeated lines
* grep Print lines matching a pattern
* wc Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
* head Output the first part of a file
* tail Output the last part of a file
* tee Read from the standard output and write to standard output and files

### Standard Input, Output and Error

Unix theme: everything is a file.

I/O redirection allows us to change where output goes and where input comes from.

Normally, output goes to the s creen and input comes from the keyboard,
but with I/O redirection, we can change that.
