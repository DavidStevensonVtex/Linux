### Group Commands And Subshells

_bash_ allows commands to be grouped together. This can be done in one of tw ways, either with a _group command_ or with a subshell.

Here is the syntax of a group command:

{ command1; command2 ; [command3; ...]}

Here is the syntax of a subshell:

( command1; command2 ; [command3; ...] )

It is important to note that because of the way _bash_ implements group commands, the braces must be separarated from the commands by a space and the last command must be terminted with either a seimicolon or a newline prior to the closing brace.

So, what are group commands and subshells good for? While they have an important difference, they are both used to manage redirection.

```
ls -l > output.txt
echo "Listing of foo.txt" >> output.txt
cat foo.txt >> output.txt
```

Using a group command, we could code this as follows:

{ ls -l; echo "Listing of foo.txt" ; cat foo.txt ; } > output.txt

Using the subshell is similar.

(ls -l; echo "Listing of foo.txt" ; cat foo.txt)  > output.txt

Using this technique we have saved ourselves some typing, but where a group command or subshell really shines is with pipelines.

{ ls -l; echo "Listing of foo.txt" ; cat foo.txt ; } | lpr

```
