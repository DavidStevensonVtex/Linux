## Chapter 35: Arrays

Arrays are a data structure that hold multiple values.

### What Are Arrays?

Arrays are variables that hold more than one value at a time.

A spreadsheet acts like a _two dimensional array_. It has both rows and columns.
An array has cells, which are called _elements_, and each element contains data.
An individual array element is accessed using an address called an _index_ or _subscript_.

Most programming languages support _multidimensional arrays_.

Arrays in _bash_ are limited to a single dimension.
Array support first appeared in _bash_ version 2.
