## Chapter 19: Regular Expressions

### What Are Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are symbolic notations used to identify patterns in text.

Not all regular expressions are the same; they vary from tool to tool and from programming language to language.

#### grep

The name _grep_ is actually derived from the phrase "global regular expression print".

```
$ ls /usr/bin | grep zip
funzip
gpg-zip
mzip
preunzip
prezip
...
```

`grep [options] regex [file...]`

##### grep options

Option Long option Description

* -i --ignore-case Do not distinguish between upper and lower case characters
* -v --invert-match Causes grep to print every line that does not contain a match
* -c --count Print the number of matches
* -l --file-with-matches Print the name of each file that contains a match instead of the lines themselves.
* -L --files-without-match Like the -l option, but print only the names of files that do not contain matches.
* -n --line-number Prefix each matching line with the number of the line within the file
* -h --no-filename For multifile searches, suppress the output of filenames

```
$ ls /bin > dirlist-bin.txt
$ ls /usr/bin > dirlist-user-bin.txt
$ ls /sbin > dirlist-sbin.txt
$ ls dirlist*.txt
dirlist-bin.txt  dirlist-sbin.txt  dirlist-user-bin.txt
```

```
$ grep bzip dirlist*.txt
dirlist-bin.txt:bzip2
dirlist-bin.txt:bzip2recover
```

```
$ grep -l bzip dirlist*.txt
dirlist-bin.txt
```

```
$ grep -L bzip dirlist*.txt
dirlist-sbin.txt
dirlist-user-bin.txt
```

#### Metacharacters and Literals

The characters in the string _bzip_ are all _literal characters_.

Regular expression metacharacters consist of the following:

`^ $ . [ ] { } - ? + ( ) | \`

All other characters are considered literals.

#### The Any Character

The first metacharacter we will look at is the dot (.) or period character, which is used to match any character.

```
$ grep -h '.zip' dirlist*.txt
bunzip2
bzip2
bzip2recover
gunzip
gzip
funzip
gpg-zip
mzip
preunzip
prezip
prezip-bin
unzip
unzipsfx
```

Note that the _zip_ program was not found.
The period matches one character, not zero characters.


#### Anchors

The caret (\^) and dollar sign (\$) are treated as _anchors_ in regular expressions.
This means they cause the match to occur only if the regular expression is found at the beginning of the line (\^) or at the end of the line (\$).

```
$ grep -h '^zip' dirlist*.txt
zip
zipcloak
zipdetails
zipgrep
zipinfo
zipnote
zipsplit
$ grep -h 'zip$' dirlist*.txt
gunzip
gzip
funzip
gpg-zip
mzip
preunzip
prezip
unzip
zip
$ grep -h '^zip$' dirlist*.txt
zip
```

#### Bracket Expresssions and Character Classes

With bracket expressions, we can specify a set of characters (including characters that would otherwise be interpreted as metacharacters) to be matched.

```
$ grep -h '[bg]zip' dirlist*.txt
bzip2
bzip2recover
gzip
```

##### Negation

If the first character in a bracket expression is a caret (^), the remaining characters are taken to be a set of characters that must not be present at the given character position.

```
$ grep -h '[^bg]zip' dirlist*.txt
bunzip2
gunzip
funzip
gpg-zip
mzip
preunzip
prezip
prezip-bin
unzip
unzipsfx
```

The caret character invokes negation only if it is the first character within a bracket expression.

##### Traditional Character Ranges

```
$ grep -h '[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]' dirlist*.txt
amuFormat.sh
GET
HEAD
NF
POST
X
X11
Xephyr
Xorg
Xwayland
$ grep -h '[A-Z]' dirlist*.txt
amuFormat.sh
GET
HEAD
NF
POST
X
X11
Xephyr
Xorg
Xwayland
```

`$ grep -h '[A-Za-z0-9]' dirlist*.txt`

How do we include the dash character as a search character.
By making it the first character in the expression.

`$ grep -h '[-AZ]' dirlist*.txt`

#### POSIX Character Classes

```
$ ls -1  /usr/sbin/[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]*
/usr/sbin/ModemManager
/usr/sbin/NetworkManager
$ ls -1  /usr/sbin/[A-Z]*
/usr/sbin/ModemManager
/usr/sbin/NetworkManager
```

```
$ echo $LANG
en_US.UTF-8
```

With this setting, POSIX-compliant applications will use a dictionary collation order rather than ASCII order. The character range `[A-Z]` when interpreted in dictionary order includes all of the alphabetic characters except the lowercase _a_, hence our results.

##### POSIX Character Class and Description

* [:alnum:] alphanumeric characters [A-Za-z0-9]
* [:word:] Same as [:alnum:] with the addition of the underscore.
* [:alpha:] The alphabetic characters. [A-Za-z]
* [:blank:] Includes the space and tab characters
* [:cntrl:] The ASCII control codes. 0 through 31 and 127
* [:digit:] The numbers 0 through 9.
* [:graph:] The visible characters. ASCII 33-126.
* [:lower:] Lowercase letters.
* [:punct:] Punctuation characters
* [:print:] The printable characters.
* [:space:] The whitespace characters including space, tab, carriage return, newline, vertical tab, and form feed. In ASCII, `[ \t\r\n\v\f]`
* [:upper:] Uppercase characters.
* [:xdigit:] Characters used to express hexadecimal numbers. In ASCII, [0-9A-Fa-f].

```
$ ls -1 /usr/sbin/[[:upper:]]*
/usr/sbin/ModemManager
/usr/sbin/NetworkManager
```

Remember, however, that this is not an example of a regular expression; rather, it is the shell performing pathname expansion.

##### Reverting to Traditional Collation Order

```
$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

To change the locale to use the traditional Unix behaviors, set the LANG variable to POSIX.

`$ export LANG=POSIX`

You can make this change permanent by adding this line to your _.bashrc_ file.


### POSIX Basic vs. Extended Regular Expressions

POSIX splits regular expression implementations into two kinds: _basic regular expressions_ (BRE) and _extended regular expressions_ (ERE).

What's the difference between BRE and ERE? It's a matter of metacharacters.

With BRE, the following metacharacters are recognized.

`^ $ . [ ] *`

All other characters are considered literals.

With ERE, the following metacharacters (and their associated functions) are added:

`( ) { } ? + |`

However, the \(, \), \{, and \} characters are treated as metacharacters in BRE if they are escaped with a backslash, whereas in ERE, preceding any metacharacter with a backslash causes it to be treated as a literal.

#### POSIX 

POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface (with the X added to the end for extra snappiness), was suggested by Richard Stallman (yes, that Richard Stallman) and was adopted by the IEEE.

Because the features we are going to discuss next are part of ERE, we are going to need a different grep. Traditionally, this has been performed by the egrep program, but the GNU version of grep also supports extended regular expressions when the \-E option is used.


#### Alternation


_Alternation_ allows a match to occur from among a set of expressions.

```
$ echo AAA | grep 'AAA|BBB'
$ echo AAA | grep -E 'AAA|BBB'
AAA
$ echo BBB | grep -E 'AAA|BBB'
BBB
$ echo CCC | grep -E 'AAA|BBB'
$ echo AAA | grep -E 'AAA|BBB|CCC'
AAA
```

```
$ grep -Eh '^(bz|gz|zip)' dirlist*.txt
bzcat
bzcmp
bzdiff
bzegrep
bzexe
bzfgrep
bzgrep
bzip2
bzip2recover
bzless
bzmore
gzexe
gzip
zip
zipcloak
zipdetails
zipgrep
zipinfo
zipnote
zipsplit
```

This expression will match the filenames in our lists that start with either _bz_, _gz_, or _zip_. Had we left off the parentheses, the meaning of this regular expression chanages to match any filename that begins with _bz_ or contains _gz_ or contains _zip_.

```
$ grep -Eh '^bz|gz|zip' dirlist*.txt
bunzip2
bzcat
bzcmp
bzdiff
bzegrep
bzexe
bzfgrep
bzgrep
bzip2
bzip2recover
bzless
bzmore
gunzip
gzexe
gzip
funzip
gpg-zip
mzip
preunzip
prezip
prezip-bin
tgz
unzip
unzipsfx
zip
zipcloak
zipdetails
zipgrep
zipinfo
zipnote
zipsplit
```

#### Quantifiers

##### \? -- Match an Element Zero or One Time

This quantifier means, in effect, "make the preceding element optional."

Let's say we wanted to check a phone number for validity and we considered the phone number to be valid if it matched either of these two forms, where n is a numeral:

* (nnn) nnn-nnnn
* nnn nnn-nnnn

We could construct a regular expression like this:

`^\(?[0-9][0-9][0-9]\)? [0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]`

```
$ echo "(555) 123-4567" | grep -E '^\(?[0-9][0-9][0-9]\)? [0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'
(555) 123-4567
$ echo "555 123-4567" | grep -E '^\(?[0-9][0-9][0-9]\)? [0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'
555 123-4567
$ echo "AAA 123-4567" | grep -E '^\(?[0-9][0-9][0-9]\)? [0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'
$ 
```

##### \* -- Match an Element Zero or More Times

The \* is used to denote an optional item; however, unlike the \?, the item may occur any number of times, not just once.

Let's say we wanted to see whether a string was a sentence; that is, it starts with an uppercase letter, then contains any number of uppercase and lwoercase letters and spaces and ends with a period.

`^[[:upper:]][[:upper:][:lower:] ]*\.`

```
$ echo "This works." | grep -E '^[[:upper:]][[:upper:][:lower:] ]*\.'
This works.
$ echo "This Works." | grep -E '^[[:upper:]][[:upper:][:lower:] ]*\.'
This Works.
$ echo "this does not" | grep -E '^[[:upper:]][[:upper:][:lower:] ]*\.'
$ 
```

##### \+ -- Match an Element One or More Times

The \+ metacharacter works much like the *, except it requires at least one instance of the preceding element to cause a match.

Here is a regular expresssion that will match only the lines consisting of groups of one or more alphabetic characters separated by single spaces:

`^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$`

```
$ echo "This that" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
This that
$ echo "a b c" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
a b c
$ echo "a b 9" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
$ echo "abc   d" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
```

Thiis does not match the line `a b 9` because it contains a non-alphabetic character; nor does it match `abc   9` because more than one space character separates the characters c and d.
