# The Linux Command Line, 2nd Edition, Â© 2019

## Chapter 11: The Environment

* printenv Print part or all of the environment
* set Set shell options
* export Export environment to subsequently executed programs
* alias Create an alias for a command

### What is Stored in the Environment

Two basic types of data in the environment:

* _environment variables_
* _shell variables_

Programmatic data:

* _aliases_
* _shell functions_

#### Examining the Environment

`$ printenv | less`

The `printenv` can calso list the value of a specific variable.

```
$ printenv USER
dstevenson
````

The `set` command, when used without options or arguments, will display both the shell and environment variables, 
as well as any defined shell functions. Unlike `printenv`, the output is sorted in alphabetical order.

`$ set | less`

```
$ echo $HOME
/home/dstevenson
```

```
$ alias
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias rm='rm --preserve-root'
```
