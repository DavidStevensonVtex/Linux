## Chapter 30: Troubleshooting

### Syntactic Errors

One general class of errors is _syntactic_. Syntactic errors involve mistypign some element of shell syntax.

```
#!/bin/bash

# trouble: script to demonstrate common errors

number=1

if [ $number = 1 ]; then
	echo "Number is equal to 1."
else
	echo "Number is not equal to 1."
fi
```

```
$ chmod 744 trouble
$ ./trouble
Number is equal to 1.
```

#### Missing Quotes

```
#!/bin/bash

# missing-quotes: script to demonstrate common errors

number=1

if [ $number = 1 ]; then
	echo "Number is equal to 1.
else
	echo "Number is not equal to 1."
fi
```

```
$ chmod 744 missing-quotes 
$ ./missing-quotes 
./missing-quotes: line 10: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
./missing-quotes: line 12: syntax error: unexpected end of file
```

Text editors like vim (:syntax on) or Visual Studio Code can indicate text it believes to be a part of a quote, and if the quote doesn't end where expected, it can indicate a missing quote character.

#### Missing or Unexpected Tokens

```
#!/bin/bash

# missing-or-unexpected-tokens: script to demonstrate common errors

number=1

if [ $number = 1 ] then
	echo "Number is equal to 1."
else
	echo "Number is not equal to 1."
fi
```

```
$ chmod 744 missing-or-unexpected-tokens 
$ ./missing-or-unexpected-tokens 
./missing-or-unexpected-tokens: line 9: syntax error near unexpected token `else'
./missing-or-unexpected-tokens: line 9: `else'
```

The error message points to a line that occurs later than the syntax error, which is the missing semi-colon before the "then" keyword.

#### Unanticipated Expansions

```
#!/bin/bash

# unanticipated-expansions: script to demonstrate common errors

number=

if [ $number = 1 ]; then
	echo "Number is equal to 1."
else
	echo "Number is not equal to 1."
fi
```

```
$ chmod 744 unanticipated-expansions 
$ ./unanticipated-expansions 
./unanticipated-expansions: line 7: [: =: unary operator expected
Number is not equal to 1.
```

This problem can be corrected by adding quotes around the first argument in the _test_ command.

`if [ "$number" = 1 ]; then`

This corrects the syntax error, but the missing number assignment produces unuseful results.

```
$ ./unanticipated-expansions 
Number is not equal to 1.
```

Make it a rule to always enclose variables and command substitutions in double quotes unless word splitting is needed.

### Logical Errors

Unlike synactical errors, _logical errors_ do not prevent a script from running.
The script will run, but will produce incorrect results.

* Incorrect conditional expressions
* "Off by one" errors.
* Unanticipated situations.

#### Defensive Programming

It is important to verify assumptions when programming.

The following script works, as long as the directory named in the variable, _dir\_name_ exists.

```
cd $dir_name
rm *
```

`cd "$_dir_name" && rm *`

This way, if the _cd_ command fails, the _rm_ command is not carried out.
This is better but still leaves open the possibility that the variable, _dir\_name_ is unset or empty, which would result in the files in the user's home directory being deleted. This could also be avoided by checking to see that _dir\_name_ actually contains the name of an existing directory.

`[[ -d "$dir_name" ]] && cd "$dir_name" && rm *`

Oten it is best to include logic to terminate the script and report an error when a situation such as the one show previously occurs.

```
#!/bin/bash

# safely-delete-files

# Delete files in directory $dir_name

if [[ ! -d "$dir_name" ]]; then
	echo "No such directory: '$dir_name'" >&2
	exit 1
fi
if ! cd "$dir_name"; then
	echo "Cannot cd to '$dir_name'" >&2
	exit 1
fi
if ! rm *; then
	echo "File deletion failed. Check results" >&2
	exit 1
fi
```

#### Watch Out for Filenames

Unix is extremely permissive about file names.

Everything except slash (/) and a null byte (a zero byte) is permissible in file names, including spaces, tabs, line feeds, leading hyphens, carriage returns, and so on.

Change:

`rm *`

to:

`rm ./*`

This will prevent a filename starting with a hyphen from being interpreted as a command option.

As a general rule, always precede wildcards (such as \* and \?) with `./` to prevent misinterpretation by commands.

#### Verifying Input

A general rule of good programming is that if a program accepts input, it must be able to deal with anything it receives. This means input must be carefully screened to ensure that only valid input is accepted for further processing.

One script contained the following test to verify a menu selection:

`[[ $REPLY =~ ^[0-3]$ ]]`
