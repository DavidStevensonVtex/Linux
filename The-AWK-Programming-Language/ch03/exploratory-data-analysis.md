## Chapter 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

_Exploratory Data Analysis_ or _EDA_, is a term first used by pioneering statistician John Tukey.

Tukey invented a number of basic data visualization techniques like boxplots, inspired by the statistical programming language S that led to the widely-used R language, co-invented the Fast Fourier Transform, and coined the words "bit" and "software".

"Finding the question is often more important than finding the answer. Exploratory data analysis is an attitude, a flexibility, and a reliance on display, NOT a bundle of techniques."

For EDA, we typically use standard Unix tools like the shell, wc, diff, sort, uniq, grep, and of course regular expressions. These combine well with Awk, and of ten with other languages like Python.

We will also encounter a variety of file formats, including comma- or tab-separated values (CSV and TSV), JSON, HTML, and XML. Some of these, like CSV and TSV, are easily processed in Awk, while others are sometimes better handled with other tools.
