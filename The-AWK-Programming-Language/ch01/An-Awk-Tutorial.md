# The AWK Programming Language, Â© 2024

## Chapter 1: An Awk Tutorial

### 1.1 Getting Started

The file `emp.data` contains three fields of information about your employees: name, pay rate in dollars per hour, and number of hours worked.

```
$ cat emp.data
Beth        21      0
Dan         19      0
Kathy       15.50   10
Mark        25      20
Mary        22.50   22
Susie       17      18
```

```
$ awk '$3 > 0 { print $1, $2 * $3 }' emp.data
Kathy 155
Mark 500
Mary 495
Susie 306
```

The part inside the quotes is the complete Awk program. It consists of a single _pattern-action statement_.

```
$ awk '$3 == 0 { print $1, $2 * $3 }' emp.data
Beth 0
Dan 0
```

#### The Structure of an Awk Program

An Awk program is a sequence of one or more pattern-action statements:

```
pattern1  { action1 }
pattern2  { action2 }
```

The basic operation of Awk is to scan a sequence of input lines, from any number of iles, one after another, searching for lines that are _matched_ by any of the patterns in the program.

Every input line is tested against each of the patterns in turn.

If a pattern has no action, the entire line is printed.

```
$ awk '$3 == 0' emp.data
Beth        21      0
Dan         19      0
```

#### Running an Awk Program

Command line:

`awk 'program' input files`

Example:

`$ awk '$3 == 0 { print $1 }' file1 file2`

You can omit the input files from the command line and just type

`awk 'program'`

In this case, Awk will apply the _program_ to whatever you type next on your terminal until you type an end-of-file signal (Control-D on Unix systems).

It may be easier to put the program into a program file:

`awk -f profile optional list of input files`

#### Errors

```
$ awk '$3 == 0 [ print $1, $2 * $3 }' emp.data
awk: cmd. line:1: $3 == 0 [ print $1, $2 * $3 }
awk: cmd. line:1:         ^ syntax error
awk: cmd. line:1: $3 == 0 [ print $1, $2 * $3 }
awk: cmd. line:1:                             ^ syntax error
```

Because of the syntax error, Awk did not try to execute this program.

### 1.2 Simple Output

The rest of this chapter contains a collection of short, typical Awk programs based on manipulation of the `emp.data` file above.

There are only two types of data in Awk: numbers and strings of characters.

Awk reads its input one line at a time and splits each line into fields, where, by default, afield is a sequence of characters that doesn't contain any spaces or tabs. The first field in the current line is called `$1`, the second `$2`, and so forth. The entire line is called `$0`.

#### Printing Every Line

The statement by itself prints the current line, so the program

`{ print }`

prints all of its input on the standard output. Since $0 is the whole line, 

`{ print $0 }`

does the same thing.

#### Printing Specific Fields

`{ print $1, $3 }`

```
$ awk '{ print $1, $3 }' emp.data
